# MobileIP
Implementation of annotated RFC 5944 in the Click Modular Router environment.
## How to run our code
The assignment included a Virtual Machine on which we can test our code.<br>
To run our code you need to do the following:
  1. In the folder "click/elements/local" you need to paste the mobileip folder from our repository <br>
  (or an alias to this folder)
  2. In the folder click/scripts/ you need to replace the provided library folder with the library folder from our repository
  
Navigate to the click/scripts folder and execute the following commands:
  1. sudo ./setup.sh (only for the initial setup)
  2. TODO add commands here
  
For the further instructions, we refer to the VMhowto.pdf file in the misc folder.
